[Observer Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/typescript/example#lang-features)



**Tasks:**

* [ ] Research how React knows when to re-render based on state.

* [ ] Build a Todo Application in either Vanilla Javascript or Typescript. (no react or any other libs/frameworks).

* [ ] When done hit me up, so we can review it and move on to React.



**Todo Application Requirements**

*You are free to use a template for the view,. we dont really care about the html/css part.*

* [ ] Create a todo
* [ ] Delete a todo
* [ ] Toggle complete a todo
* [ ] 3 tabs(filters) to show todos
  * [ ] completed
  * [ ] active
  * [ ] all
* [ ] amount of todos based on filter.
* [ ] Store your state in localstorage
* [ ] When a todo is completed it should give me an indication. For example a strike-through.
* [ ] Make sure there's input validation. No empty todos.
